Joining twice in C++ can cause program crash. So check if the thread is joinable before joining.


You can detach from a parent thread using detach() so the main thread does not wait for the parent thread to complete. Double detach is also a problem.

try_lock() is a non-blocking call. Tries to lock the mutex. It returns index of mutex if it was not able to lock. The behavior is undefined if
the same thread tries to lock the mutex twice.


std::async:
It runs a function asynchronously and returns a std::future that will hold
the result. There are three launch policies. It potentially spawns
a task/thread. Deferred policy means that it creates a thread if possible 
(there are cases where OS is overloaded and it might not be able to 
create the thread).

Conditional variables are used to notify other threads.
Notify one/Notify all:
Notify one thread or all
