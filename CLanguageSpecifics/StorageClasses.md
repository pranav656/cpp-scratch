# Notes on Storage Classes
`auto`: Default storage class, the variables can be accessed within the scope of the block.

`register` : The compiler tries to store these variables in the register of a microprocesser.

`extern` : It tells us that the variable is defined in another file. They can be modified by different files/blocks. 

`static`: They are initialized only once and are destroyed on termination of the program.
