# cpp-scratch
Contains C++ code and concepts I am learning and revising.

Note: The implementations here are definitely not the cleanest (so no judgements). It's only
to keep a record of things I am learning. May end up in an organized PDF with tests
and optimizations some day.

Problems taken from youtube videos, Blind75, Elements of Programming Interviews or Leetcode.
I also plan to add protypes of interesting concepts I am learning.
