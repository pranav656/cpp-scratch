# cpp-scratch
Contains code and concepts I am learning and revising.

Note: The implementations here are definitely not the cleanest (so no judgements). It's only
to keep a record of things I am learning. May end up in an organized PDF with tests
and optimizations some day.

Problems taken from youtube videos, Blind75 or Elements of Programming Interviews book.
