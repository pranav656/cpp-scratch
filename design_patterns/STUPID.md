# STUPID 
Describes anti-patterns or design flaws in software dev. 

Singleton: Inflexible design that restricts the instantiation of a class to a sinle instance leading to tight coupling 
and difficulties in testing and maintenance.

Tight Coupling: Classes and modules are tightly interconnected, making it difficult to modify or replace one or more
component without affectingothers.

Untestability: Code that is difficult to test due to poor design choices, such as excessinve dependencies or lack
of separation of concerns.

Premature Optimization: Optimizing code prematurely without profiling or identifying performance bottlenecks, 
leading to complex and hard to maintain solution.

Indescriptive Naming: Poorly named variable functions, or classes that obscure the intent of the code, making it hard to
understand and maintain.

Duplication: Duplicated code or logic across different parts of the system increasing the risk of bugs
and making maintenance difficult.
