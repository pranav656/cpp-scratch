A composition is a concept in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that describes the relationship between
whole and it's existential parts. Take the example of a house containing rooms, the rooms cannot exist without
the house.

In the case of aggregation, the classes can exist independently of each other.

Association simply indicates that there is a relationship between two classes. A common example used
for explaining this concept is that a student can have multiple teachers and a teacher can have
multiple students.
