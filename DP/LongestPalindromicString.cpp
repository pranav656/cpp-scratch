// LC5 - Longest Palindromic subsequence
// Brute force solution:
// Check every position in the string to check
// if it's a palindrome or not. Time complexity 
// O(N^2.N = N^3) for this solution. 
// Optimized approach: 
// Go through each position and check the substrings
// as though it's at the center and expand outwards.
// This improves time complexity to O(n^2).
// (TODO) DP approach:
class Solution {
public:
    string longestPalindrome(string s) {
        
    }
};
